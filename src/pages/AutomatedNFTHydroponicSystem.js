          <p>
            Designed and built a completely automated NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) hydroponic system that actively 
            monitors and adjusts water nutrient levels and pH. This project was a good exercise for me and my other mechanical 
            engineering friend to practice mechanical design, creating electronic control systems, and software programming 
            to create a fully automated growing system capable of maintaining optimal growing conditions.

            <h3>Outcomes and Results</h3>
            <p>
              By pairing an Arduino with a pH sensor, total-dissolve solid sensor, and water pump, we were able to successfully create a hydroponic system that maintains optimal water conditions
              for any plant. The system dispenses acid or base depending on the pH reading, or more nutrients depending on the TDS reading. The lettuce grew beautifully. I also would like to compare 
              the systems grow speed compared to a non-enhance lettuce. For this specific system, we wanted to start up with a simpler plant to prove the concept like lettuce. We plan to enhance the 
              setup with additional software and hardware features, such as an IoT device to give the system internet functionality. Additionally, we also plan to implement more in depth data metrics, 
              with graphs over time and possibly a better reinforced frame.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Reflecting on this project, it reminds me of the simpler ways engineering can be utilized to optimize and solve everyday problems. This was one of the first projects I completed outside of the guidance
              of a professor or employer, and it was especially rewardinng to acheive the result because of that. Back then, in small personal projects like this, I often felt uncertain because it seemed like the
              barrier to entry was just too high and it was difficult to commit. After doing this project, I am now constantly looking for similar aspects in my life that can be optimized with projects like this; sp I can be pushed
              to think and engineer beyond the classroom or the workplace.
