          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I built a new PC recently with one of the new air-cooled RTX NVIDIA cards from MSI. These cards are known for their large size, as the GPU comes with a GPU support bracket that is supposed to help prevent the GPU from  
            sagging/deflecting excessively when installed. However, there was a fatal design problem with the included support bracket, as it was not able to fit in the lower PCIe slots. Because I wanted to use these lower slots, I decided to make
            my own. My improved design retains the magnetic bottom of the original, but instead opts for a screw-in support vs. one that is clipped. This allows for more refined and easier adjustment on the fly. I iterated
            on the fitment of this design quickly using 3D printing to ensure the threads interfaced properly. I glued foam to the support top to help soften the support surface and minimize scratching.

            <h2>Outcome and Results</h2>
            <p>
              The custom GPU support bracket was able to successfully eliminate GPU sag, removing excess stress on the PCIe slot. The 3D printed assembly was more than enough to support the GPU and keeping it
              perpendicular to the motherboard. It's threaded design is an improvement over the old one, as it allows for the active adjustment of the support height without having to remove it from the case.
              The magnet on the bottom ensures that if the case is moved or bumped that it won't displace the support.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              It's little projects like these that I love to seek out because it allows me to exercise my desire to continually improve existing designs. I'm always looking for ways to apply my engineering skills
              to make life a little bit easier, and this project was a great example of that. I recognized a product that I used that needed to be improved, and I was able to modify the design to meet my needs. 
              Additionally, this project continues to increase my fascination with the power of 3D printing. Without thi technology, the speed in which I made this part just would not have been possible. 
              3D printing to me is the clear future of engineering and manufacturing at a rapid pace. I am looking forward to the next time I am able to exercise these skills in my every day life.
