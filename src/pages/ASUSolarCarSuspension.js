          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I proposed this project during my fall semester in my senior year of my bachelor's degree. Going into the year, as the mechanical lead of
            university's solar car team, I knew that the car still desperately needed to start design and fabrication of our rear suspension. I decided to
            enlist the help of some fellow classmates to help me with the development of this system. Because of my familiarity with the solar car
            and the existing challenges of implementing the design, I led the project and was heavily involved in the CAD modeling, finite element analysis, and fabrication
            of the system. It was important for this system to comply with American Solar Challenge regulations, as well as criterias that were set in place by the solar car team.
            The selected design was a trailing arm with a raised shock absorber mounting point to close distance between the trailing arm and
            chassis whilst also utilizing the most stiff points of the chassis. Welded together with chromoly steel tubing and machined components, the suspension complied with
            the competition loading conditions, was compatible with existing solar car systems, and also was optimized for strength, weight, and manufacturability.

            <h3>Outcomes and Results</h3>
            <p>
            By installing a working raised trailing arm suspension onto the solar car, I successfully created a mechanical 
            system that exemplified my ability to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Formulate design objectives, constraints, functions, and metrics</li>
              <li>Create and evaluate design concept alternatives</li>
              <li>Manage a design project scope, schedule, and budget</li>
              <li>Construct, test, and deliver a proof-of-concept prototype</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            In my master's year, I plan to continue dynamic testing as the aeroshell of the car gets built and possibly incorporate
            a fatigue test analyis to see if the design has infinite life.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Reflecting on this project, I am very proud of the work that was accomplished. This was one of the first projects I completed that I was able to execute the
              the entire mechanical design process from start to finish, building off the skills and knowledge I had gained throughout my degree.
              Even better, the project was related to something I was extremely passionate about, making it easy to give 110% of my effort. 
              I realized what I was truly capable of as an incoming mechanical engineer to the industry - to be able to provide working solutions, especially in the automotive industry.
              I hope to translate the skills demonstrated in this project to a career in building an optimistic future for human transportation.
