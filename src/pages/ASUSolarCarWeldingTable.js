          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Before we could start making the chassis, we needed a surface that we could fixture to during the welding process. To do this, the team and I designed and built a basic welding table. 
            Essentially a modified workbench, we fastened a large plate of mild steeland square tube stand-offs to convert the bench to a usuable weld fixture table. The plate of mild steel was
            manually drilled into over 600 times by the team with a magnetic drill press to make holes for fixturing components. Each drilled hole had a pilot hole made by a center drill on a CNC
            router. Without making this first, there would be no solar car.

            <ul>
              The completion of this small project was a big one for the team, as it was the first hands on endeavor we took and a big step towards starting fabrication of our chassis. The table worked greatly
              for locating fixures akin to the CAD assemblies.The project gave us some foundational skills that we ended up also utilizing during the chassis making process. Due to the fact that we drilled the 
              fixture holes manually there was a slight variation on hole placement throughout the welding table. Because of this, we have plans to create a Welding Table V2, that is modular, laser-cut/water 
              jetted, and then tapped to ease fixturing challenges. Fabricating it with this method should give us some added precision to future fixture weldments.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This project to me was a perfect preview of what was to come for the solar car. It was hard work and tedious work, drilling over 600 holes straight on the steel plate but the necessity of the table
              made us push through. The same ideology applied for all future systems regarding the solar car, especially due to the custom nature of it. This project reinforced my understanding of design items for
              fabrication, and thinking ahead of what manufacturing processes will be used to make parts that I designed. It was also cool to be introduced to the concepts of making toolpaths in CAM, even in this
              simple application. It highlighted the importance of understanding the stock material, the machining order of operations, and ways to optimize manufacturing speed. The experience gained from this 
              project has been invaluable in subsequent engineering endeavors.
