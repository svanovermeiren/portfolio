          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Vertical axis wind turbines are an experimental and gimmicky type of wind turbine that have been proven as a concept, but is it economically feasible at a large-scale? They are harder to manufacture,
            and less efficient than their horizontal axis counterparts by themselves. However, there is a potential use case for them that may truly harness their full potential, and that is what this research
            project aimed to tackle. Acting as the final report for my graduate level wind energy course, my group and I conducted a presentation and wrote a report on our findings regarding this. Please check it
            out below!

            <p>

              My group and I found that vertical-axis wind turbines have real potential in hybrid systems, where horizontal axis turbines are used in conjunction with vertical axis ones.
              In our preliminary simulations, we saw an observed increase in energy production when arranged in this configuration and the implied economic benefits we thought were worth
              further exploration. Future research could emphasize on optimizing wake interaction models using more advanced computational methods. Long-term reliability and maintenance
              are big factors to be considered, and would probably required prototype moddels of this hybrid system to determine if the benefit outweighs the potential cost.

              This project was a fun change in what I normally had researched throughout my mechanical engineering degree. Normally researhc topics on projects remained more top-level and broad, not
              delving too deep into the feasibility to one system, however this research project let me focus on one niche concept. Even better, it was a niche concept I did not know much about prior to
              taking this course, and it was pertaining to a renewable energy system which is something I was very interested in. I look to continue widening my horizons to the possiblity of new sustainable ways
              to generate energy, despite the course reaching its end.
