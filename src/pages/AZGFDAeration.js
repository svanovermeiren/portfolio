          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            In the tail end of my freshman year, I joined ASU's Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) - where I took on my first team leadership role. My role in this project involved leading 
            early-stage system design and validation for an off-grid aeration solution to support a fish hatchery. Work included preliminary testing, data analysis, and early component 
            selection to inform a robust, energy-efficient aeration system architecture. The team and I traveled out to Show Low, Arizona where the hatchery was located to find out more information about the site. 
            I helped create protoype circuits implementing solar power to power an aeration system for the hatchery.

            <p>
              With the use of generous EPICS funding and university-provided materials, the team and I were able to conduct many tests on small-scale aeration systems that were solar-powered. To obtain a proof-of-concept
              was a big milestone, however implementing the system at a wide scale was a different beast as the conditions were much different. We were able to present our findings to a panel of industry engineers
              to review our designs and gain valuable feedback to set us up for success. Unfortunately, I left the team before I could see how the concept was implemented at the hatchery as I gained a bigger role in the solar car team, but the direction the project was going was very promising.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This project will always have a special place in my heart for its role in getting me really interested in working in a project team. When I started on this project, I was a young 
              freshman/sophomore still freshly finding out what exactly I wanted to do in engineering, and this project was greatly helpful in realizing my passions. Without being on this project, I would not
              have developed such a strong desire for a career path emphasizing a more sustainable - in any way, shape, or form. I also appreciated the project for diversifying my skills as an engineer by introducing
              me to many concepts on power and circuitry that I would not have received in my undergrad.
